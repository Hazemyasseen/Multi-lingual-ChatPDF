# Multi-lingual-ChatPDF
ChatPDF is an innovative AI-powered tool designed to revolutionize the way you interact with PDF documents. It allows users to upload PDFs and engage with their content through a conversational interface. One of its standout features is its multilingual support, enabling seamless interaction with PDFs in various languages. This makes it an invaluable resource for students, researchers, and professionals who need to extract specific information quickly and efficiently.

I created this ChatPDF using Ollama and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Ollama is an open-source platform that simplifies running powerful language models locally, giving me more control and flexibility. By combining Ollama with RAG, I enhanced the chatbotâ€™s capabilities by integrating targeted retrieval of relevant information from external sources, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses12. This setup allowed me to build a robust and secure local chatbot tailored to my needs.
